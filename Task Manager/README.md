### 📦 Week 1 - Task Manager Console App

As part of the first week's assignment, I built a simple **Task Manager** using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

#### ✅ Features:
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Filter tasks by status (TO DO, DOING, DONE)  
- Edit task description or status  
- Delete tasks  
- Input validation with graceful error handling  

#### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Java  
- Console-based interaction  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes, Enums)  
- Defensive programming using custom input handling
