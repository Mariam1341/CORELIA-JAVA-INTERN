# Corelia Internship Projects 🚀

This repository contains my projects and practical tasks for the **Java Internship Program at CORELIA**.

The repository will be continuously updated as I progress through the internship, learning new technologies and building more complex projects.

- Delete tasks  

### 🛠️ Technologies:

- Java  
- Console-based interaction  
- OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Methods, Class Design)
