## ✅ **Completed Projects**

### 📦 Week 1 - Task Manager Console App

As part of the first week's assignment, I built a simple **Task Manager** using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

#### ✅ Features:
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Filter tasks by status (TO DO, DOING, DONE)  
- Edit task description or status  
- Delete tasks  
- Input validation with graceful error handling  

#### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Java  
- Console-based interaction  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes, Enums)  
- Defensive programming using custom input handling

### 🐾 Week 2 - Pet Clinic Console App

This project is a **console-based Pet Clinic Management System** that performs full CRUD operations using **JDBC and MySQL**.

#### ✅ Features:
- Add a pet (name, type, age, owner name, owner phone)  
- View all pets  
- Search pets by name/type/owner  
- Update pet information  
- Delete pets  
- MySQL integration with a pre-defined schema  

#### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Java  
- JDBC  
- MySQL  
- Console-based interaction  
- Database connectivity  
- Clean separation between DAO and models  

> 📝 **Note**: CSV export and in-memory sorting were intentionally removed to focus on database-first operations.
