## ‚úÖ **Completed Projects**

### üì¶ Week 1 - Task Manager Console App

As part of the first week's assignment, I built a simple **Task Manager** using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

#### ‚úÖ Features:
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Filter tasks by status (TO DO, DOING, DONE)  
- Edit task description or status  
- Delete tasks  
- Input validation with graceful error handling  

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies:
- Java  
- Console-based interaction  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes, Enums)  
- Defensive programming using custom input handling

### üêæ Week 2 - Pet Clinic Console App

This project is a **console-based Pet Clinic Management System** that performs full CRUD operations using **JDBC and MySQL**.

#### ‚úÖ Features:
- Add a pet (name, type, age, owner name, owner phone)  
- View all pets  
- Search pets by name/type/owner  
- Update pet information  
- Delete pets  
- MySQL integration with a pre-defined schema  

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies:
- Java  
- JDBC  
- MySQL  
- Console-based interaction  
- Database connectivity  
- Clean separation between DAO and models  

---

### üìö Week 3 - Student Management API

This project is a **basic RESTful Student Management System**, developed using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**.

#### ‚úÖ Features:
- Create a new student  
- View all students  
- View student by ID  
- Update student information  
- Delete student  

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies:
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Web  
- Spring JDBC  
- MySQL  
- RESTful API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This version is kept simple and does **not** include DTOs, validation, or custom exception handling ‚Äî the focus is on mastering core Spring Boot concepts first.

---

### üìö Week 4 - Book & Author Management API (Spring Boot + JPA + DTOs)

This week I built a Book and Author Management System using Spring Boot, JPA, and MapStruct. The goal was to dive deeper into entity relationships and practice mapping between entities and DTOs.

### ‚úÖ Features:
- Add / update / delete books and authors
- View all books or authors
- Search for books by title, category, or author
- Search for authors by name
- Proper entity relationships using **@ManyToOne** and **@OneToMany**
- Exception handling with custom global error responses
- Clean data transfer using **DTOs + MapStruct**
- Validation using `@Valid`, `@NotBlank`, etc.
- Layered architecture (Controller ‚Äì Service ‚Äì Repository)

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL
- MapStruct
- Maven
- Lombok
- Javax Validation
- RESTful API Design
- Swagger

### üß† Key Learnings:
- Many-to-One & One-to-Many relationships with JPA
- How to use DTOs to clean up responses and requests
- Custom mapping logic using @Named in MapStruct
- Using @ComponentModel("spring") to integrate MapStruct with Spring

### üåê Week 5 - JSF Registration Form

This week, I built a basic registration form using JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.2 to practice server-side rendering and form binding.

### ‚úÖ Features:
- Simple registration form (name, email, password)
- Data binding to managed bean (request-scoped)
- Validation using JSF `<f:validate>` and required fields
- Feedback messages displayed with `<h:messages>`
- Simple success page after form submission

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies:
- Java EE
- JSF 2.2 (Mojarra)
- XHTML (Facelets)
- Managed Beans (Java classes)
- Maven
