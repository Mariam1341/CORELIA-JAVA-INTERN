## ✅ **Completed Projects**

## 📦 Week 1 - Task Manager Console Application

As part of the first week's assignment, I built a simple **Task Manager** using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

### ✅ Features:

- Create tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Filter tasks by status (TO DO, DOING, DONE)  
- Edit tasks  
- Delete tasks  

### 🛠️ Technologies:

- Java  
- Console-based interaction  
- OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Methods, Class Design, Enums)  

### 🎬 Demo Video
