# Corelia Internship Projects 🚀

This repository contains my projects and practical tasks for the **Java Internship Program at CORELIA**.

The repository will be continuously updated as I progress through the internship, learning new technologies and building more complex projects.

## ✅ **Completed Projects**

### 📦 Week 1 - Task Manager Console App

As part of the first week's assignment, I built a simple **Task Manager** using Java, applying core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

#### ✅ Features:
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Filter tasks by status (TO DO, DOING, DONE)  
- Edit task description or status  
- Delete tasks  
- Input validation with graceful error handling  

#### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Java  
- Console-based interaction  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes, Enums)  
- Defensive programming using custom input handling

### 🐾 Week 2 - Pet Clinic Console App

This project is a **console-based Pet Clinic Management System** that performs full CRUD operations using **JDBC and MySQL**.

#### ✅ Features:
- Add a pet (name, type, age, owner name, owner phone)  
- View all pets  
- Search pets by name/type/owner  
- Update pet information  
- Delete pets  
- MySQL integration with a pre-defined schema  

#### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Java  
- JDBC  
- MySQL  
- Console-based interaction  
- Database connectivity  
- Clean separation between DAO and models

### 📚 Week 3 - Student Management API

This project is a **basic RESTful Student Management System**, developed using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**.

#### ✅ Features:
- Create a new student  
- View all students  
- View student by ID  
- Update student information  
- Delete student  

#### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Web  
- Spring JDBC  
- MySQL  
- RESTful API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

> ⚠️ **Note**: This version is kept simple and does **not** include DTOs, validation, or custom exception handling — the focus is on mastering core Spring Boot concepts first.
